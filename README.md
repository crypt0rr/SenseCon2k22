# SenseCon 2022

*Bold IT Admin*
*A Short Story*
*by Dick M. Bunn*

IT Admin John looked at the tiny keys in his hands and felt calm.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his loud surroundings. He had always hated hot Dark IT room with its unrealistic, unknown umbrellas. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel calm.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of crypt0rr. crypt0rr was a helpful author with curvy spots and sticky arms.

John gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a bold, scheming, beer drinker with handsome spots and wobbly arms. His friends saw him as a vacant, vague volcano. Once, he had even helped an unrealistic disabled person cross the road.

But not even a bold person who had once helped an unrealistic disabled person cross the road, was prepared for what crypt0rr had in store today.

The sun shone like sleeping humming birds, making John sleepy.

As John stepped outside and crypt0rr came closer, he could see the thoughtless glint in his eye.

"Look John," growled crypt0rr, with a friendly glare that reminded John of helpful dogs. "I hate you and I want Use Welcome as password. You owe me 3685 euros."

John looked back, even more sleepy and still fingering the tiny keys. "crypt0rr, I am the IT admin - I decide," he replied.

They looked at each other with sparkly feelings, like two mushy, mashed mice skipping at a very brave Halloween party, which had techno music playing in the background and two tight-fisted uncles eating to the beat.

John regarded crypt0rr's curvy spots and sticky arms. "I don't have the funds ..." he lied.

crypt0rr glared. "Do you want me to shove that tiny keys where the sun don't shine?"

John promptly remembered his bold and scheming values. "Actually, I do have the funds," he admitted. He reached into his pockets. "Here's what I owe you."

crypt0rr looked healthy, his wallet blushing like a plain, purring phone.

Then crypt0rr came inside for a nice drink of beer and reset his password to "Welcome@SenseCon2022".
