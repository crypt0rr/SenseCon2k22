# Challenge 2 - Answers

*"John is scratching his head.. Why do I have so many collisions with people?" I am IT, I am King!*

The point John is trying to make in this challenge are the collisions. He can't find out why he is having these collisions, can't get his head around why they keep happening. Same goes for CRC32, the algorithm used for this challenge.

Since the list of collisions that can be found is endless I used a couple random collisions in the keyspace of 9 to 11 numbers. Words were to obvious.
